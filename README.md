1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial is in the business of providing secure digital banking. The Artemis team requested a minor technical audit to ensure best practices were being followed in their Spring Boot RESTful API implementation. Their goal was to maintain a high level of security throughout ongoing development. My task was to identify security threats, apply secure coding methods to counter them, and suggest mitigation techniques to protect client data and meet regulatory compliance.

2. What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
I successfully identified several vulnerabilities such as hard-coded credentials, insecure HTTP methods, and missing input validation using both static code analysis and manual inspection. Addressing these vulnerabilities reinforced the importance of secure coding. Secure software helps protect end users from data breaches and ensures the company's reputation remains intact. Encouraging discussions around security and taking proactive steps ultimately contribute to long-term system integrity and customer trust.

3. Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The most challenging part of the assessment was interpreting the output from dependency-check tools and correlating them with known vulnerabilities. Despite this difficulty, the experience taught me how to prioritize risks based on CVSS scores and apply targeted fixes. This process helped improve my ability to conduct meaningful, practical assessments and implement effective remediation strategies.
